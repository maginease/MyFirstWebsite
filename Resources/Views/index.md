 <p> <h1>Hello,#(name)!</h1> </p>
  <p><strong>Here's a way to 패드립 with Swift programming language:</strong></p>
  <p><code> class mom { //... } </code></p>
  <p><code> var yourMom:mom? </code></p>

  <p>This is 패드립 because having a constant with <code>class mom</code> as optional is inferred as <code>nil</code>, which tells that he/she is motherless.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, we declared <code>yourMom</code> to be variable because there might be a chance that your mom can change (yo mama can get divorced and you get a new mom). Anyways, since we haven't declared anything, the value stays <code>nil</code>.</p>
  <p>Let's test this one on our Playground<br> We first declare <code>Man</code> and <code>Prostitution</code></p>

      <p>then, we will also declare <code>Mom</code></p>

  <p>What the initializer does is it iterates through the partners array whom your mama had sex with and tells whether yo mama is a whore by assigning <code>Prostitution</code> instance if there are any men other than yo dada who had sex with yo mama.</p>
  
  <p>Let's say yo mama has this input:</p>

      <p>Yo mama sure is a whore! Let's find out yo mama exists</p>

      <p>Swift tells us that <code>yoMama</code> is <code>nil</code>; you don't have a mom!</p>
