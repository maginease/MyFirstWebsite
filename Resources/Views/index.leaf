  <p><strong>Here's a way to 패드립 with Swift programming language:</strong></p>
  <p><code> class Mom { //... } </code></p>
  <p><code> var yourMom:Mom? </code></p>

  <p>This is 패드립 because having a constant with <code>class mom</code> as optional is inferred as <code>nil</code>, which tells that you are motherless.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, we declared <code>yourMom</code> to be variable because there might be a chance that your mom can change (yo mama can get divorced and you get a new mom). Anyways, since we haven't declared anything, the value stays <code>nil</code>.</p>
  <p>Let's test this in our Playground:</p>
  <p> We first declare <code>Man</code> and <code>Prostitution</code></p>

      <p>then, we will also declare <code>Mom</code></p>
      
      <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/734414084480434200/867689984831127592/mom.png" width="600" height="700">
          
  <p>What the initializer does is it iterates through the partners array whom your mama had sex with and tells whether yo mama is a whore by assigning <code>Prostitution</code> instance if there are any men other than yo dada who had sex with yo mama.</p>
  
  <p>Let's say yo mama has this input:</p>

      <p>Yo mama sure is a whore! Let's find out if yo mama exists</p>
      
      <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/734414084480434200/867689976288116736/result.png" width="1400" height="400">
      
      <p>Swift tells us that <code>yoMama</code> is <code>nil</code>; you don't have a mom!</p>
